# Add full-text search to your application

You now know everything you need to add full-text search capabilities to your application.

Open up the code from the server file `server/controllers/movies.mjs` once more, and edit the `search` method to use full-text search.

:::tip
You'll need to use the `aggregate` method instead of the `find` method you used earlier. Check out the [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.aggregate/) for more details.
