# Start the application

You might have noticed in the terminal window at the bottom that there is an error message.

::info
If you don't see the error message, look at the bottom part of the screen, and look for a tab called `start server`.

You will need to create a new file called `server/.env` and add the following line to it:

```bash
PORT=5050
ATLAS_URI=<your MongoDB Atlas connection string>
EMBEDDINGS_SOURCE=<openai or serverlessEndpoint>
EMBEDDING_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key if needed>
```

Once this file is created, look for that `start server` tab at the bottom, and restart the server.

## Connect to MongoDB

The first line is the port that the server will run on. You can keep this one to 5050 for now.

The second line is the connection string to your MongoDB Atlas database. You can find this in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard under "Connect" and then "Connect your application". You can copy the connection string and replace `<password>` with the password you created earlier.

## Choose an embeddings source

The third line is the embedding source. You can choose between `openai` and `serverlessEndpoint`.

For now, you can set it to `serverlessEndpoint`. More on this topic later today.
