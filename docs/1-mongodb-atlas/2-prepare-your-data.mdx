# Load the sample dataset

For this Lab, you will use the standard sample dataset for MongoDB Atlas. This dataset contains a number of sample databases and collections. The one we will be using is the `sample_mflix` database, which contains a collection of movies.

## Load Sample Dataset

From the Atlas UI page, find the button with the three dots on the right side of your cluster and click on it. Then click on the "Load Sample Dataset" option.

<img
    alt="Load sample dataset button"
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-1-mongodb-atlas/load-sample-data.png')}
    width="100%"
/>

This will load approximately 300 Mb of data into your cluster. It may take a few minutes to complete.
