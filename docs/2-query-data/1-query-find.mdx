# Querying data

The first thing you'll want to do with your data is query it. To do so, you will need to start by connecting to your database.

## Connecting to your database

Your server is already set up and connected to your database. It used the connection string from your `.env` file to connect to it.

If you want to look at what the server is doing, you can look at the `server/db/conn.mjs` file.

```js
const uri = process.env.ATLAS_URI;
// Create a MongoClient that will manage the connection to the database.
const client = new MongoClient(uri);
await client.connect();

await client.db("admin").command({ ping: 1 });
console.log("Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!");
const collection = client.db("sample_mflix").collection("embedded_movies");
```

This code takes your connection string and creates a `MongoClient` object. This object is used to connect to your database.

It also pings the database to make sure you are connected. If you are connected, you will see the message `Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!` in your console.

Finally, it declares a collection called `collection` that you will use to query your data.

## Querying your data

The first thing we'll do is query the data using a `find` method. This method will return all the documents in your collection matching the query.

In your CodeSanbox, open the file `server/controllers/movies.mjs`, and look for the method `find`.

This function will return the data from the database. It is currently returning an empty array.

The search term is passed as a parameter to the function. You can access it using `searchTerm`.

Now go to the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/) and find out how to query your data using the `find` method.

You should limit the search results to 20 and only return the required fields.

Once you have the code, add it to your CodeSanbox.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
  async find(searchTerm) {
    const movies = await collection
      .find({ title: searchTerm }, {
        title: 1,
        year: 1,
        "imdb.rating": 1,
        fullplot: 1,
        poster: 1,
        released: 1,
        genres: 1
      })
      .limit(20)
      .toArray();

    return movies;
  }
```
</div>
</details>

## Test it out -- and see the limitations

You can now enter data in the search box and search for movies. Try searching for `The Terminator` or `Coraline`. Those should return a movie.

Now try a more broad search like `Terminator`. You should see an empty array.

This is because the `find` method is looking for an exact match. If you want to search for a partial match, you will need to use a different method.
